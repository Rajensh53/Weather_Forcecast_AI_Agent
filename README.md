# Weather_Forcecast_AI_Agent
This is a small AI automation project built in n8n that acts as a Weather Forecast Agent. It fetches daily weather data from the Open-Meteo API, processes it using a large language model (LLM), and automatically sends a personalized weather report via email. Perfect example of combining AI + automation + APIs for real-world use.
